## 🧭 Road to OOP – My Object-Oriented Programming Journey

### 🏁 Overview

This repository documents my journey to mastering **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using Java.
My goal is to build a strong foundation in OOP principles — from **basic concepts like classes and objects**
to **advanced design patterns and SOLID principles**, and ultimately apply them in **real-world projects**

---

### 🎯 Objectives

* Understand the **core concepts** of OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
* Apply OOP in **Java** through hands-on examples and mini-projects
* Learn to write **clean, maintainable, and testable** code
* Gain practical skills for **technical interviews** and **industry-level development**

---

### 📚 Daily Roadmap

#### 🧩 Day 1 – Classes, Objects & Constructors

**Goals:**

* Understand what classes and objects are
* Learn about constructors, `this` keyword, and object creation
* Practice with simple examples like `Person`, `Book`, and `Student`

**Tasks:**

* [ ] Create `Person.java`, `Book.java` classes
* [ ] Implement parameterized and default constructors
* [ ] Use `this` keyword to resolve naming conflicts
* [ ] Write simple `Main` class to demonstrate object creation

**Notes:**

> “Objects are real-world entities, and classes are their blueprints.”

#### 📦 Day 2 – Encapsulation & Access Modifiers

* Focus on data hiding and validation with getters/setters
* Learn about `private`, `protected`, `public`, and default access
* Build `BankAccount` class with deposit/withdraw logic

---

#### 🧬 Day 3 – Inheritance & super()

* Implement parent-child relationship between classes
* Explore constructor chaining and method overriding

---

#### ⚙️ Day 4 – Polymorphism

* Study overloading vs overriding
* Learn about upcasting/downcasting and dynamic dispatch

---

#### 🧠 Day 5 – Abstraction & Interfaces

* Differentiate between abstract class and interface
* Implement `Payment` system example with multiple implementations

---

#### 🧩 Day 6 – Advanced OOP Topics

* Explore `static`, `final`, inner classes, and `Object` class methods

---

#### 🧱 Day 7 – SOLID Principles & Design Patterns

* Learn Factory and Strategy patterns
* Apply composition over inheritance

---

#### 🚀 Day 8 – Final Project

* Build a mini real-world app using OOP design (Clinic or Telemedicine model)
* Write tests and documentation
* Practice interview questions
